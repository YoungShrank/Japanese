1. Q: is it better to learn words first or to learn grammars first?  
   A: they supplement each other.
   - when you learn characters, you should learn words after getting on soundings to practice them especially the tone.
   - when you learn words, you should learn grammars after getting on soundings so that you can practice them in sentences,where the words' meaning is clearer.
   - when you learn grammars, it's the same as learning words.  
if you acquire some words, you may understand a sentence,but if you only acquire some grammars, you will absolutely be confused about the sentence.
