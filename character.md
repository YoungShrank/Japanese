# Characters
characters is an elementary component in a language.what a character looks like is specified by its *glyph*.what a character sounds like refers to its *pronunciation*.we are already familiar with the characters in English(*latin alphabet*).As for Chinese,there are many different characters. fortunately,they shared limited *phonemes* and *strokes* respectively for pronunciation and appearance.
## Japanese characters
there are 4 types of Japanese characters:*hiragana*,*katakana*,*kanji* and *romaji* .
- **hiragana**:the most common and most useful character in Japanese.it is used for build words ,for phonetics,just like latin alphabet in English.
- **katakana**:each hiragana has a corresponding katakana.they share the same pronunciation while have a more regular appearance.
- **kanji**:which makes japanese not so english-like.you can take it as a contraction on several characters.their shapes are no different from *Hanzi*.
- **romaji**:namely latin alphabet.commonly used for phonetics.

| type | example |usage |amount |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
| hiragana | あいうえお | writing/phonetic |limited |
| katakana | アイウエオ | writing(borrowed words) |limited |
| kanji | 漢字 | writing |many |
| romaji | aiueo | phonetic/typing |limited |

so what can we draw from these facts? if you want to speak japanese,you only need to know hiragana and romaji.if you want to read japanese,learning katakana additionally is enough.if fact, when you learn hiragana,you will also learn katakana and romaji at the same time.
let's cut the crap and start learning.
