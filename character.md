# Characters
characters is an elementary component in a language.what a character looks like is specified by its *glyph*.what a character sounds like refers to its *pronunciation*.we are already familiar with the characters in English(*latin alphabet*).As for Chinese,there are many different characters. fortunately,they shared limited *phonemes* and *strokes* respectively for pronunciation and appearance.
## Japanese characters
there are 4 types of Japanese characters:*hiragana*,*katakana*,*kanji* and *romaji* .
- **hiragana**:the most common and most useful character in Japanese.it is used for build words ,for phonetics,just like latin alphabet in English.
- **katakana**:each hiragana has a corresponding katakana.they share the same pronunciation while have a more regular appearance.
- **kanji**:which makes japanese not so english-like.you can take it as a contraction on several characters.their shapes are no different from *Hanzi*.
- **romaji**:namely latin alphabet.commonly used for phonetics.

| type | example |usage |amount |
| --- | --- | --- |--- |
| hiragana | あいうえお | writing/phonetic |limited |
| katakana | アイウエオ | writing(borrowed words) |limited |
| kanji | 漢字 | writing |many |
| romaji | aiueo | phonetic/typing |limited |

so what can we draw from these facts? if you want to speak japanese,you only need to know hiragana and romaji.if you want to read japanese,learning katakana additionally is enough.if fact, when you learn hiragana,you will also learn katakana and romaji at the same time.
let's cut the crap and start learning.

## the pronunciation

### single syllable
- vowels and consonants  
a japanese syllable is usually a combination of a vowel and  a consonant or a just single vowel.it represents a single  articulation,resonance controlled by vowel and airflow controlled by consonant.(no basic,i guess it )
the pronunciation of a hiragana or katakana only contains a single syllable.so, when you master these vowels and consonants,you almost learn all the hiragana's pronunciation. moreover,the consonants can be clustered to groups,in which the consonants have similar manners of articulation(*e.g.* g and k).
- sokuon  
a pause.っ
- hatuon  
a kind of nasal .ん|ン like /ŋ/  in English
- yojunon  
  \<consonant>i can be followed by  y\<vowel> (-i+y-=-y-) to form a syllable..*e.g.* kya nyu kyo.to represent it as a single articulation, y\<vowel> is written in lower case(*e.g.* ゃ).if you are familiar with **compound finals**,you will think yojuon and vowel are the same thing.

### in words
when pronouced in words,there is  tone of syllable that varies(like accent in English). with the tone in words,you can separate the them when you hear them.unlike Chinese,the tone doesn't varies in a single syllable.each syllable has a specific tone,**low tone** or **high tone**.as for a word, there are 3 kinds of variations of tone.
1. high low---
2. low high---
3. low high--- low 

here  "---" means the tone  is constant.
### how to learn
1. find similarity between the pronunciation in japanese and what you have learned.for example,the consonants in English,the accent in English,the tone in music(do for low tone and  mi for high tone).
2. practice in single syllable and then in words.it may be difficult at preliminary stage, but it's enjoyable.all you need is time.
3. accompanied with physical movement when practicing the tone(or just imagine it).for example,you can lift your hand when you speak a high tone.


## the glyph

for a Chinese,the glyph may not be a matter,even when it comes to the kanji.
you can take a look at my [notes](日本語.pdf) on strokes and orders of strokes of japanese characters.I think these decompositions make it easier to learn the glyph.
the complete strokes are seperated by commas.and you will find that some stokes are not seperated by commas. they form a **joined-up writing**. you will also notice there is some structure like "r".i call it a "**tangent**",which is path that sharply turns back but smoothly turns back again.you can compare it with "V"(sharply turns back) and "C"(smoothly turns back).another structure is "**spiral**",like "の".
