notes in learning Japanese?

# inspiration
i meet a germany friend in [interpal](https://www.interpals.net).while i'm a Chinese who is a beginner of Japanese,he/she turned to me for tips in learing japanese. it is a bit weird,a chinese teaching a  germany japanese in english.but my english is not well good enough to share my tips by conversation. as a result,this project war created.


# attention
this project is not a complete japanese learning guide.it is just a collection of my learning notes.the correctness of the notes is not guaranteed,but as correct as possible.
anyhow,it's practical.
