# Annotation (meta-language)
there we introduce some notations for describing the grammar of japanese. i use `<symbol>`to mark a grammar component.
1. `[x]`: appears or not.`e.g.`
2. `{x}`: repeat once or more.`e.g.xxx`
3. `x|y`: x or y,one of them.`e.g.b`
4. `f:a`:variate with a,specified by a.`e.g.f:maria can mean a sentence with maria as subject if i declared  to explain f this way.`
5. `x&y`: x together with y,regardless of order.`e.g.yx`

alright,i know you must be confused about the notation.let's see some examples.
### examples for notation

| notation | instance |meaning|
|:---|:---|:---|
| `<verb>`| play| action|
| `<verb><noun>`|play games| action on a object|
| `<verb>&<adverbial>`|happily play;play happily| action specified by adverbial|

i think it makes the annotation more clear.
# grammar
let's start with a very simple sentence.how to express "i am a chinese" in japanese? supposed you have learnt the words "わたし"(I),"ちゅうごくじん"(chinese) ,then it simply goes like this:`わたし は ちゅうごくじん です`.almost the same as english,right?it complys with the grammar `<noun1><link><noun2><voice>`,which link`<noun1>` and `<noun2>`.as for `です` there,you can temporarily 
take it as something express the sentence's voice,specially,a statement voice.now,try to build more sentences.for example,"you are an American".
